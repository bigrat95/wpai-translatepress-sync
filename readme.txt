Import multilingual content into TranslatePress when using WP All Import. Third-party integration; not affiliated with TranslatePress.

== Description ==

**Oli Import Sync for TranslatePress** lets you import multilingual content directly into TranslatePress when using WP All Import. Ideal for bulk-importing products, posts, or any content that already has translations in your CSV/XML.

= Features =

* **Title, Content & Excerpt** - Import translated titles, descriptions, and excerpts
* **Post / Product Slugs** - Import or auto-derive translated post and product slugs from the translated title (requires SEO Pack)
* **WooCommerce Categories** - Import translated category names and slugs
* **WooCommerce Attributes** - Import translated attribute values (colors, sizes, etc.)
* **Variation Descriptions** - Import translated variation descriptions
* **Variable Products** - Full support for WooCommerce variable products and variations
* **Multiple Languages** - Import all your languages simultaneously
* **Human Reviewed Status** - Translations are saved as "Human Reviewed" (status 2) so auto-translation will not overwrite them
* **Automatic Paragraph Stripping** - Paragraph breaks are flattened into a single text block so TranslatePress always matches one string per description

= Requirements =

* WP All Import Pro
* TranslatePress Multilingual
* TranslatePress Custom API plugin (provided by TranslatePress support)
* TranslatePress SEO Pack (optional, for slug translations)

= How It Works =

1. Map your default language fields normally in WP All Import.
2. Add custom fields for translated content (e.g., `_trp_title_fr_CA`).
3. Run the import — translations are automatically synced to TranslatePress.
4. Temporary custom fields are cleaned up after import.

= Disclaimer =

This is an unofficial integration plugin. "TranslatePress" is a trademark of Cozmoslabs and is referenced here only for compatibility purposes. This plugin is developed independently and is not endorsed by, sponsored by, or affiliated with Cozmoslabs.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `oli-import-sync-for-translatepress` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Ensure TranslatePress and TranslatePress Custom API are also active
4. Configure your import in WP All Import with the translation custom fields

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What custom fields should I use? =

**For posts/products:**
* `_trp_title_[lang]` - Translated title
* `_trp_content_[lang]` - Translated content/description
* `_trp_excerpt_[lang]` - Translated excerpt (optional)
* `_trp_slug_[lang]` - Translated post/product slug (optional, requires SEO Pack). If empty and "Auto-derive post slug from translated title" is enabled, the slug is built from `_trp_title_[lang]`.

**For WooCommerce categories:**
* `_trp_cat_[lang]` - Translated category names (pipe-separated)
* `_trp_cat_slug_[lang]` - Translated category slugs (requires SEO Pack)

**For WooCommerce variation descriptions:**
* `_variation_description` - Default language variation description (standard WooCommerce field)
* `_trp_variation_desc_[lang]` - Translated variation description

**For WooCommerce attributes:**
* `_trp_attr_[attribute-slug]_[lang]` - Translated attribute values (pipe-separated)

Replace `[lang]` with your language code (e.g., `fr_CA`, `es_ES`, `de_DE`).

= What happens to existing translations? =

They are updated/overwritten with the new translations from your import. Post slug translations are also force-replaced (TranslatePress' own slug insert uses INSERT IGNORE, so the plugin clears the existing row first).

= Will auto-translation overwrite my imported translations? =

No. Imported translations are saved with status 2 (Human Reviewed), which protects them from being overwritten by automatic translation.

= How do I import multiple categories or attribute values? =

Use pipe-separated values. Example: `_trp_cat_fr_CA` = "Chaises|Tables|Bureaux"

= Do I need the SEO Pack for slug translations? =

Yes. The TranslatePress SEO Pack add-on is required for any slug translation (post, product, or category). Title, content, excerpt, attribute and category-name translations work without it.

= Is this plugin affiliated with TranslatePress / Cozmoslabs? =

No. This is an independent third-party integration. "TranslatePress" is referenced for compatibility only.

== Changelog ==

= 3.16.0 =
* NEW: Mirror WordPress's `-2`, `-3` slug auto-disambiguator from the EN slug onto the auto-derived translated slug
* Prevents TranslatePress' `make_slugs_unique()` from clobbering trailing numbers in titles (e.g. "...inoxydable-304" no longer becomes "...inoxydable-305")
* Only triggers when EN's `-N` is a real WP duplicate suffix (another post owns the base slug) and N is 2..999
* No-op for explicit `_trp_slug_[lang]` mappings — those still win
* Variations (`product_variation`) continue to be skipped (they have no public URL)

= 3.15.0 =
* NEW: Post / product slug translation support via `_trp_slug_[lang]`
* NEW: "Auto-derive post slug from translated title" setting (default ON) — builds the translated slug from `_trp_title_[lang]` when no explicit slug is provided

* Field Reference and Dashboard updated to surface the new slug field and toggle
